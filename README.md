### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @oscthe

I work as a quantitative analyst in Stockholm, Sweden. I have a wide data wrangling/modelling/analysis-interest where I'm especially interested in forecasting and predictive analytics. Below you'll find a list of projects:

- Automating variable selection for regression models. ([GitHub-repo]()) ([Website-link]())
- Review of machine learning developments in credit risk modelling. ([GitHub-repo]()) ([Website-link]())
- Pricing currency options using neural networks. ([GitHub-repo]()) ([Website-link]())
- 

I also have a [website](https://oscthe.github.io) where I write about projects, papers and other stuff that I find interesting/am working on.
