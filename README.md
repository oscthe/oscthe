# Hi there! :wave:

My name is [first name] [last name],<br />
I am a Quantitative Analyst from Stockholm, Sweden. I have a wide data science interest with a special focus on applications in finance and economics. I'm currently focusing on deep learning applications within finance which is what I currently mostly read, code and post about here on GitHub. Some projects I have developed within this area:

- [Neural Network Architecture for Option Pricing](http://www.google.com):<br />
  I evaluate different configurations of NNs for pricing simulated options from the Black Scholes model. In this repo I leverage my own [implementation](https://github.com/oscthe/option-price-simulation) for simulating options.
- [OMX30 one-day-ahead price direction forecast using NN](http://www.google.com):<br />
  

I also review papers and write about data science, finance, economics, programming and other related topics on my [website](WEBSITE-LINK). Feel free to check it out and let me know your thoughts!
